Platformer game written in python
using pygame


Created to implement and try out the tutorial created by dafluffypotato,
to learn the basic concepts of gamedev & pygame


Currently in this state this is not a finished "game", but most of the concepts talked about in the tutorial is implemented.

I want to return to this project and make it my own, by not following the exact things he has done during the tutorial,
but for now this project is in halt.
